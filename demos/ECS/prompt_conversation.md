## Initial prompt:
Create a project to the following requirements:
- Everything to be deployed using CloudFormation.
- Create the project structure using multiple files to isolate the different infrastructure to make it easier for beginners to understand.
- Simple web application designed to run in AWS ECS as a service with a single task.
- The application will run in a Docker container and use Node.js version 22.
- Use `us-west-2` for the AWS region.
- Create a VPC with a single public subnet to host the application.
- Use Fargate for placement and `awsvpc` networking.
- All resources are configured with a `"costcenter"` tag and a value of `"demo"`.
- Ensure that the Docker container is built and pushed to ECR as part of the CloudFormation deployment.
- Make sure that ECR authentication is working before attempting to push the container.
- Create a bash script to deploy all of the resources.
- Create a zipfile of the project so I can download it.

## Prompt:
The project seems to work, but the ECS task exits after printing the following:
```
"Hello from Node.js 22 on ECS Fargate!"
```
This should be a service which can be queried using an HTTP GET.
